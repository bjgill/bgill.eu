I am publishing this page to allow my colleagues to compare their salaries with me. Therefore, I hereby consent to any and all processing (etc.) of this data by those working at GDS or Metaswitch.[^1]

# Government Digital Service (2019-present)

I am currently a Senior Developer at 'Proficient A' on the DDAT London pay scale, with a full-time-equivalent salary of £63 500.

Before that, as a Developer, my full-time-equivalent salary was £56 000.

I work part-time (90%). The civil service pension adds the equivalent of another ~20-25%.

# Metaswitch (2015-8)

My salary at Metaswitch ended at £48 000, with an annual bonus of about £2000. I also had a number of share options, but left before the Microsoft acquisition, so they were worthless.

The Metaswitch starting salary for graduate hires was £32 000 when I joined.
