I am publishing this page to allow my colleagues to compare their salaries with me. Therefore, I hereby consent to any and all processing (etc.) of this data by those working at GDS or Metaswitch.[^1]

# Government Digital Service (2019-present)

I currently work part time (90%), with a full-time-equivalent salary of £56 000. The civil service pension adds the equivalent of another ~20%.

I was hired as a Developer, for which the advertised range was £48 000 to £56 000. That was for band 'A.London'.

# Metaswitch (2015-8)

My salary at Metaswitch ended at £48 000, with an annual bonus of about £2000. I also had a number of share options, but left before the Microsoft acquisition, so they were worthless.

The Metaswitch starting salary for graduate hires was £32 000 when I joined, and is now £35 000.
