I am publishing this page to allow my colleagues to compare their salaries with me. Therefore, I hereby consent to any and all processing (etc.) of this data by those working at any organisation below.[^1]

# Government Digital Service -> Cabinet Office -> Crown Commercial Service (2020-present)

I am currently a Senior Developer. My salary was:

* for the first 3 months, at 'Proficient A' on the DDAT London pay scale, with a full-time-equivalent salary of £63 500
* thereafter, at 'Proficient B' on the DDAT London pay scale, with a full-time-equivalent salary of £69 500

I work part-time (90%). The civil service pension adds the equivalent of another ~20-25%.

I've been working on the Digital Marketplace all this time - we've just had a few transfers.

# Government Digital Service (2019-20)

A Developer, with a full-time-equivalent salary of £56 000.

I ended up working part-time (90%). The civil service pension added the equivalent of another ~20-25%.

# Metaswitch (2015-8)

My salary at Metaswitch ended at £48 000, with an annual bonus of about £2000. I also had a number of share options, but left before the Microsoft acquisition, so they were worthless.

The Metaswitch starting salary for graduate hires was £32 000 when I joined.
