I'm Benjamin Gill,[^1] a developer working for you[^2] and employed by the [Crown Commercial Service](https://www.crowncommercial.gov.uk/). I'm working on the [Digital Marketplace](https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/), a procurement platform for digital services.

[^1]: I prefer 'Benjamin', _not_ 'Ben'
[^2]: Though technically the Crown

I am also an amateur theatrical technician, avid board gamer, omnivorous reader, and really quite fond of opera.

My preferred pronouns are he/him or they/them.

I maintain a [public salary history]({{< ref "page/salary_history.md" >}}).
