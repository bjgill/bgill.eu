I'm Benjamin Gill,[^1] a developer working for you[^2] and employed by the [Government Digital Service](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/). I'm helping to develop [GOV.UK Verify](https://www.gov.uk/verify), a way to securely access government services online.

[^1]: I prefer 'Benjamin', _not_ 'Ben'
[^2]: Probably. If you're not a UK citizen and not living in the UK, I'm unlikely to be directly helping you, sorry.

I am also an [amateur theatrical technician](https://www.camdram.net/people/benjamin-gill), avid board gamer, omnivorous reader, and really quite fond of opera.

My preferred pronouns are he/him (though with no objection to gender-neutral alternatives).
