I am Benjamin Gill,[^1] a software engineer and recent physics graduate, working for [Metaswitch Networks](https://www.metaswitch.com/). I am also an [amateur theatrical technician](https://www.camdram.net/people/benjamin-gill), member of the [local Green party](https://www.enfieldgreens.org.uk/), an omnivorous reader, and quite fond of operas and operettas.

[^1]: I prefer 'Benjamin', _not_ 'Ben'

My preferred pronouns are he/him (though with no objection to gender-neutral alternatives).
