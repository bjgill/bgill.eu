I intend to republish this statement annually (at some point in January). Please feel free to remind me if I lapse. I shall try to ensure that past versions of this page are available on the internet archive.

To the best of my knowledge, I have not inserted any backdoors or similar into any software, nor been party to any attempts to do so, nor been asked to do so.

To the best of my knowledge, I have not inserted any backdoors or similar into any software, nor been party to any attempts to do so, nor been asked to do so.

I shall not continue publishing updates to this page after the end of the year. Whatever my personal views, there is a difference between doing such things at the instruction of a private company and ministers. As such, I don't think it would be appropriate to keep maintaining this page as a civil servant.
