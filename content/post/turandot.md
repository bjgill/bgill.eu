Last Sunday, I saw a performance of [_Turandot_](http://www.roh.org.uk/productions/turandot-by-andrei-serban), Puccini's final opera, at the Royal Opera House. It was very enjoyable, but gave me some interesting thoughts.

let me start by saying that I think it was a good production. It seemed as if there were some missed opportunities, though.

Most obviously, the gong. I'm sure there was a good reason why Calef only pretended to strike it. However, that pretence was very obvious.

I want to talk more substantively about the direction, however. 

It seems to me the the greatest Directors are capable of completely subverting or twisting a work whilst changing not a word or note.

For some works, this is very necessary. It is a sad fact that most of the great operas were composed centuries ago. A not insubstantial fraction are strongly imbued with cultural mores that, if played straight, can be quite grim and unpleasant today.

My best/worst experience of this was a production of _Kiss Me, Kate_, where I follow-spotted most of the performances. It is a deeply misogynistic piece that treats _The Taming of the Shrew_ as an instruction manual. The Director appeared not to have noticed this, and, as a crew, we were generally quite sick of it by the end of the run.

Sometimes, the merest token suffices. I've seen two productions of _HMS Pinafore_ in recent years.
