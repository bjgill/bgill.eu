Last week, the Department of Work and Pensions slipped out [new statistics](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/benefit-cap-number-of-households-capped-to-february-2017) that reveal the impact of the benefit cap. Introduced by the Tory-LibDem coalition in April 2013, it was made even more harsh in February.

Enfield is particularly hard-hit. 3377 households in the borough have been trapped by the cap since its introduction. This is the 3rd most, despite Enfield only being the [59th most populous local authority](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/populationestimatesforukenglandandwalesscotlandandnorthernireland)!

The Tories, Labour and LibDems all voted in favour of the benefit cap. Greens will introduce a Universal Basic Income to ensure that all people in the UK can have a decent standard of life.
