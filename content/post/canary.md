**EDIT**: to avoid excessively spamming my blog, I've moved the canary to [{{< ref "page/canary.md" >}}]({{< ref "page/canary.md" >}}).

To the best of my knowledge, I have not inserted any backdoors or similar into any software, nor been party to any attempts to do so, nor been asked to do so.

I intend to republish this statement annually. Please feel free to remind me if I lapse. I shall try to ensure that past versions of this page are available on the internet archive.
