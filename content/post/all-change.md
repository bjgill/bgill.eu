After three years at Metaswitch, I'm moving to the [Government Digital Service](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/). I'm looking forward to working directly for the benefit of the general public.

As a member of the Civil Service, I need to both be and to be seen to be politically impartial. This ensures that ministers of all stripes can be confident working with the Service.

Thus, I shall be ceasing my political campaigning. I will also refrain from "making public remarks on matters of local or national controversy", to paraphrase Civil Service guidance.

As a side-effect, I shall be moving closer in to London. Please let me know if you want my new address.
