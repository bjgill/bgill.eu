It will be my great privilege to be the Green party candidate for Edmonton in the upcoming election.

Green policies are the best for moving towards a better, fairer UK. We have clear, sensible proposals for an equitable economy and a democratic Brexit (amongst other things), and would end inhumane Tory cuts to welfare and the NHS. We also support important local measures such as action on air pollution and 20 mph speed limits.

I look forward to talking with Edmonton residents over the course of the campaign.
