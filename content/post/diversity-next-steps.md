This is an essay exploring themes of diversity and inclusion in the UK software industry. Starting with some basic assumptions, I will seek to explain why it is good to have a diverse and inclusive workforce. I will end by listing some ways of improving.

None of the ideas expressed here are original. There have been a lot of people exploring these themes, and I would strongly recommend reading the sources for more information. This essay has been prompted by a recent [rather good conference]({{< ref "post/alterconf.md" >}}), from which much of thinking here has been drawn.

# Preliminaries

## The prime assumption

The entirety of what follows can be derived from a single assumption - _there is no link between gender/race/etc. and inherent ability as a software developer_. This is eminently defensible, but I do not plan to do so here.[^2]

[^2]: It can be derived from the higher-level assumption that all humans are equal.

## Things excluded

Arguments from morality, ethics, or philosophy will not be covered here. These could be considered the most persuasive arguments. However, I do not have the necessary intellectual tools to make them effectively, so will not.

This discussion focuses on the context of the UK technology industry. There is no doubt much that could be said about other industries and contexts. However, ...

Most of this discussion is directed at company-scale problems and solutions in the private sector. There is, no doubt, much that can be done at other scales. However, it seems likely that 

All that which follows applies to all lesser-privileged characteristics, whether [protected](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/section/4) or not. However, gender is probably the best-studied and most discussed - hence its prevalence.

# Why be diverse and inclusive?

## Talent pool

Substantially less than half the human population is comprised of cis, straight, white men.[^3] The [prime assumption]({{< relref "#the-prime-assumption" >}}) indicates that programming ability should be evenly distributed. Therefore, by confining itself predominantly to a sub-set of the population, an employer is at a competitive disadvantage, due to having a small talent pool from which to draw.

[^3]: Still fewer of whom wear blue shirts.
