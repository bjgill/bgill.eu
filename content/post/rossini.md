So I've been listening to quite a bit of Rossini over the past couple of days, starting with the _Barber of Seville_. It turns out that I really quite like his music.

This should perhaps not be too surprising: Mozart is (and remains) my favourite composer, and Rossini (a contemporary) writes music that feels very similar; the Act I finale of _Barber_ being very reminiscent of various Mozart equivalents, with the same beautiful layering of voices.

Now to find out when the ENO is next putting one of his operas on...
