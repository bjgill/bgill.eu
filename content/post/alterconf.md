I recently attended an [interesting conference](https://alterconf.com/conferences/london-england) that focused on diversity and inclusion in the software industry. What follows are the notes I made during the talks, typed up whilst still fresh. It's possible that I may be misrepresenting or in error - the [sketch notes](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23sketchnote%20from%3Aherecomesjaycee%20since%3A2017-03-31%20until%3A2017-04-02&src=typd) should be more authoritative. Search terms for more material are in **bold**.

# [Open Open Source](https://alterconf.com/talks/open-open-source)

Codes of Conduct (CoCs) are important for Open Source Software (OSS) projects (and also conferences). Don't just blindly copy-paste from somewhere else and declare it 'done'. CoCs are meaningless unless enforced. Link to it from readme.

Complaint about unnecessarily/inappropriately gendered language. The speaker created a slackbot that corrected people who used e.g. 'guys'.

In OSS, code is not actually that important - newsletters, design, moderation, and docs have a greater impact.

# [Started from the Margins now we here: our unfortunate empathy advantage](https://alterconf.com/talks/started-margins-now-we-here-our-unfortunate-empathy-advantage)

Those who are marginalised often have to practice code-switching/double consciousness. This is a distraction.

Sympathy != empathy - the latter implies some meaningful action.

Those who are marginalised have an advantage - they have been forced to develop empathy. Empathy is important in design (e.g. UX). There is an empathy gap - minorities' energy expenditure often appears invisible. Empathy is based on lived experience, so cannot be taught - it must be earned.

# [Music of changes: an autobiographical talk about transition and immigration in the tech community](https://alterconf.com/talks/music-changes-autobiographical-talk-about-transition-and-immigration-tech-community)

Brazil has a major problem with homo-/transphobia. Hence the speaker's move to Ireland.

The 'geek'/'nerd' stereotype is exclusionary to those who come from other cultures (and who are not cis-male).

Transitioning to trans-woman, the speaker noted that people became less accepting (e.g. of criticism).

How to make your business more trans-friendly:

* Explicitly (and prominently) include gender identity in HR discrimination policies.
* Have transition guidelines (Ericsson did).
* Avoid gender essentialism - inclusive pronouns are important here.

# [Letâ€™s get personal! (about games)](https://alterconf.com/talks/let%E2%80%99s-get-personal-about-games)

This was a talk about autobiographical games; games which acted as self-care/catharsis for dev and/or user. See **Cognitive Behavioural Therapy is for Hackers** and **Spoon Theory**.

# [Fantastic Bots and Where To Find Them](https://alterconf.com/talks/fantastic-bots-and-where-find-them)

Discussed Twitter bots as a form of art/poetry. Avoid being intrusive - err on the side of caution.

> Software reproduces oppression unless explicitly designed not to.
 
See **Transphobic joke detection**.

# [Trapped By The Trappings](https://alterconf.com/talks/trapped-trappings)

> There's no line item in my timesheet for panic attacks.

In tech, it's hard to socialise if you don't drink or like certain situations. It also takes a lot of energy to pretend to be 'normal'.

On meetings:

* publicise an agenda
* don't cancel at the last moment (this also helps remote workers)
* consider other people's time/energy

The speaker expressed the concept of the 'retrospective wall'. Here, topics for discussion are posted (semi) anonymously on post-it notes on a wall. This lowers the barrier to raising difficult/contentious topics.

Code reviews are hard, not least because getting tone/context across is difficult. Don't erase the humanity of the coder - we are naturally invested in our creative work. Don't assume stupidity. Code review _could_ be a face-to-face collaborative process between reviewer and coder.

To help people with mental health problems:

* Most importantly, talk, listen, and _act!_
* Ensure mental health is an option in the sick leave system.
* Meeting-free days (perhaps 1/week?) help
* Quiet spaces
* Varied social events
* On-site help (councilor?)

# [Not one of the guys - finding myself in an industry dominated by cis men](https://alterconf.com/talks/not-one-guys-finding-myself-industry-dominated-cis-men)

See **How to stop hurting women in tech**.

The speaker spoke of having internalised misogyny.

'guys' - minorities bear the burden of validating themselves. This is particularly difficult for junior people.

Harassment (even subtle) in the workplace had a significant effect.

As a women, the speaker was described as a 'troublemaker', 'taking things too seriously', and had to fight for a seat at the table.

See **Shaving my head made me a better programmer**.

It is easy to believe we are in a meritocracy and miss all the small things. Constantly explaining stuff is emotional work.

The speaker spoke of using the three strike rule to decide when to stop trying/giving the benefit of the doubt to colleagues.

The speaker mentioned the importance of managing energy levels. Minorities do not have an obligation to disrupt the industry.

The women waving Slack emoji as a subtle response to the use of 'guys'/etc.

Employers should better acknowledge 'soft' skills, empathy and emotional work.

If you are sufficiently privileged as to be able, having a 'fuck-off fund' can provide a measure of reassurance. Support networks are also important - hold allies accountable, and them to do work for you.

# [There are No Safe Spaces - About Identity, Intersectionality & Empathy](https://alterconf.com/talks/there-are-no-safe-spaces-about-identity-intersectionality-empathy)

Hypodescent - lowest privilege 'wins'.

The speaker argued that 'politically correct' just means 'treating other people with respect'.

Safe spaces can be difficult - in a safe space for one of your 'labels', you can get hated for another.

A good way of assessing those who want to join a group is to ask them how they will avoid hurting people.

# [Learning How To Cook : A Call For DIY Recommendation Algorithms](https://alterconf.com/talks/learning-how-cook-call-diy-recommendation-algorithms)

Recommendation algorithms reflect the preferences and values of the _implementor_. This speaker therefore argued in favour of citizen-created algorithms.

# [Non-verbal Accessibility](https://alterconf.com/talks/non-verbal-accessibility)

The speaker described their experiences. Quiet spaces are important, especially at large social events.

# [Choose your own business adventure](https://alterconf.com/talks/choose-your-own-business-adventure)

See **The Creative Mind**. 

The speaker chose to leave their job and found a company. The primary motivation was control and freedom. Running a business requires spending a lot of time cultivating relationships.

See **In the company of women**.

# [What will a diverse tech industry look like?](https://alterconf.com/talks/what-will-diverse-tech-industry-look)

There exists a male visual language for identifying 'programmer', with no equivalent for women.

See **Whistling Vivaldi**.
