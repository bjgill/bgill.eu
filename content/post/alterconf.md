I recently attended an [interesting conference](https://alterconf.com/conferences/london-england) that focused on diversity and inclusion in the software industry. What follows are the notes I made during the talks, typed up whilst still fresh. It's possible that I may be misrepresenting or in error - the [sketch notes](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23sketchnote%20from%3Aherecomesjaycee%20since%3A2017-03-31%20until%3A2017-04-02&src=typd) should be more authoritative. Search terms for more material are in **bold**.

# [Open Open Source](https://alterconf.com/talks/open-open-source)

Codes of Conduct (CoCs) are important for Open Source Software (OSS) projects (and also conferences). Don't just blindly copy-paste from somewhere else and declare it 'done'. CoCs are meaningless unless enforced. Link to it from readme.

Complaint about unnecessarily/inappropriately gendered language. The speaker created a slackbot that corrected people who used e.g. 'guys'.

In OSS, code is not actually that important - newsletters, design, moderation, and docs have a greater impact.

# [Started from the Margins now we here: our unfortunate empathy advantage](https://alterconf.com/talks/started-margins-now-we-here-our-unfortunate-empathy-advantage)

Those who are marginalised often have to practice code-switching/double consciousness. This is a distraction.

Sympathy != empathy - the latter implies some meaningful action.

Those who are marginalised have an advantage - they have been forced to develop empathy. Empathy is important in design (e.g. UX). There is an empathy gap - minorities' energy expenditure often appears invisible. Empathy is based on lived experience, so cannot be taught - it must be earned.

# [Music of changes: an autobiographical talk about transition and immigration in the tech community](https://alterconf.com/talks/music-changes-autobiographical-talk-about-transition-and-immigration-tech-community)

Brazil has a major problem with homo-/transphobia. Hence the speaker's move to Ireland.

The 'geek'/'nerd' stereotype is exclusionary to those who come from other cultures (and who are not cis-male).

Transitioning to trans-woman, the speaker noted that people became less accepting (e.g. of criticism).

How to make your business more trans-friendly:

* Explicitly (and prominently) include gender identity in HR discrimination policies.
* Have transition guidelines (Ericsson did).
* Avoid gender essentialism - inclusive pronouns are important here.

# [Letâ€™s get personal! (about games)](https://alterconf.com/talks/let%E2%80%99s-get-personal-about-games)

This was a talk about autobiographical games; games which acted as self-care/catharsis for dev and/or user. See **Cognitive Behavioural Therapy is for Hackers** and **Spoon Theory**.

# [Fantastic Bots and Where To Find Them](https://alterconf.com/talks/fantastic-bots-and-where-find-them)

Discussed Twitter bots as a form of art/poetry. Avoid being intrusive - err on the side of caution.

> Software reproduces oppression unless explicitly designed not to.
 
See **Transphobic joke detection**.

# [Trapped By The Trappings](https://alterconf.com/talks/trapped-trappings)

> There's no line item in my timesheet for panic attacks.

In tech, it's hard to socialise if you don't drink or like certain situations. It also takes a lot of energy to pretend to be 'normal'.

On meetings:

* publicise an agenda
* don't cancel at the last moment (this also helps remote workers)
* consider other people's time/energy

The speaker expressed the concept of the 'retrospective wall'. Here, topics for discussion are posted (semi) anonymously on post-it notes on a wall. This lowers the barrier to raising difficult/contentious topics.

Code reviews are hard, not least because getting tone/context across is difficult. Don't erase the humanity of the coder - we are naturally invested in our creative work. Don't assume stupidity. Code review _could_ be a face-to-face collaborative process between reviewer and coder.

To help people with mental health problems:

* Most importantly, talk, listen, and _act!_
* Ensure mental health is an option in the sick leave system.
* Meeting-free days (perhaps 1/week?) help
* Quiet spaces
* Varied social events
* On-site help (councilor?)

# [Not one of the guys - finding myself in an industry dominated by cis men](https://alterconf.com/talks/not-one-guys-finding-myself-industry-dominated-cis-men)

See **How to stop hurting women in tech**.
