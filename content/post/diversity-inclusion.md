This is an essay exploring themes of diversity and inclusion in the UK software industry. I will seek to explain why it is good to have a diverse and inclusive workforce and list some suggestions for improvement.

None of the ideas expressed here are original. There have been a lot of people exploring these themes, and I would strongly recommend reading the sources for more information. This essay has been prompted by a recent [rather good conference]({{< ref "post/alterconf.md" >}}), from which much of thinking here has been drawn.

[Questions/comments/operatic allegories welcome]({{< ref "page/about.md#contact" >}}).[^1]

# Preliminaries

Much of what follows can be derived from a single assumption - _there is no link between gender/race/etc. and inherent ability as a software developer_. This is eminently defensible, but I do not plan to do so here.[^2] If you disagree, this text may not be for you.

[^2]: It can be derived from the higher-level assumption that all humans are equal.

Arguments from morality, ethics, or philosophy will not be covered here. These could be considered the most persuasive arguments. However, I do not have the necessary intellectual tools to make them effectively, so will not.

//All that which follows applies to all lesser-privileged characteristics, whether [protected](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/section/4) or not. However, gender is probably the best-studied and most discussed - hence its prevalence.

# Why be diverse and inclusive?

## Talent pool

Substantially less than half the human population is comprised of cis, straight, white men.[^3] The [prime assumption]({{< relref "#preliminaries" >}}) indicates that programming ability should be evenly distributed. Therefore, by confining itself predominantly to a sub-set of the population, an employer is at a competitive disadvantage, due to having a small talent pool from which to draw.

[^3]: Still fewer of whom wear blue shirts.

## Performance



The performance of those less privileged is inexorably linked to the inclusivity and culture of the society they inhabit. In 

## Recruitment mediocrity

One of the major problems in the software industry is recruitment. There appears to be no settled best practice for determining programming ability/talent. In the absence of good process, it is easy to fall back on pattern matching - hiring people who 'look the part' or are similar to those already at the company.

Thus, the diversity of recruitment intake is a good proxy for the effectiveness of the recruitment system. A mediocre process inevitably produces a non-diverse workforce. 

## Empathy

One of the consequences of being less privileged is that one must expend considerable energy and effort to fit in. This is an unfortunate advantage - such people will have the life experiences that will, of necessity, caused them to develop empathy.

Empathy is the ability to understand others' desires and needs and a will to act (mere sympathy lacks the latter). In software development, the ability to empathise with the users of your product is vital in ensuring that users wish to use. Thus, a software company may gain a competitive advantage by hiring more lesser-privileged people.

## Societal effects

To quote from an AlterConf speaker, "software reproduces oppression unless explicitly designed not to". If your development team is non-diverse, you are at high risk of not noticing inadvertent discrimination. Commonly-known examples of this being the difficulties many facial-recognition systems have with non-white faces or voice-recognition with female voices.

As software products come to influence society ever more, maintaining non-diverse development teams seems like an excellent means of extending this into society at large.
