Several minutes ago, I went to attempt to watch a DVD on my Windows PC. I normally use Windows Media Player for such things. However, in this instance I need to use VLC instead. Unfortunately, Windows does not make it easy for me to get to VLC from the start menu.

This sort of nonsense is one of the reasons why I tend to prefer a Linux desktop. Unfortunately, PC games still release with patchy Linux support, so I fear I'll be tied to Windows for some time yet. Thank goodness for dual booting, though.
