This is a small side-project to produce some sample populations in order to have
a point of comparison when discussing the degree of diversity in UK technology
companies. I am doing this by producing sample populations based on the
population at large and other similar companies. I also have plans to extend
this to be able to produce populations representing the weighted average of
graduate recruitment.

Currently, this takes the form of [a spreadsheet](/diversity_populations.ods).

## Work left to do
- [ ] Convert the data to a nicer format
- [ ] Get a full (or at least fuller) set of university diversity statistics
- [ ] More categories - disabled/LGBTQ+?
- [ ] Have some sort of nice visualisation of all this
